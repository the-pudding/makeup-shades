A few of the bestselling brands (Maybelline, Bare Minerals, Estee Lauder) actually hold out pretty well on the darker end of the spectrum, with some supporting dark skin tones that Fenty doesn’t even cover.

While other big mainstream brands had 40 shades as well, here – aside from Fenty – the other five brands had 30 or fewer shades on offer.
